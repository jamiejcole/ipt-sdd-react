# IPT-SDD-React
Rebuild of [SDD-IPT-Questions](https://github.com/jamiejcole/SDD-IPT-Questions) in React. Mainly made for learning purposes, but also very helpful for HSC content revision.

## Contributing
If you'd like to help add content for your own HSC courses, please feel free to! Please generate a JSON file named `{your-course}-hsc-questions.json`, in the following format:

```
[
 {
   "year": 2021,
   "qNum": 22,
   "qPart": "b",
   "Marks": 3,
   "time": 4.5,
   "syllabus": "9.1.1",
   "keywords": "Social and ethical issues",
   "Outcome": "H7.2"
 },
 ]
 ```
 
 The way you can easily achieve this is using Excel, and exporting data to a CSV, and using online CSV to JSON conversion tools, such as [this one](https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm). 
 
 See the below screenshot of an Excel spreadsheet used to generate the CSV.
